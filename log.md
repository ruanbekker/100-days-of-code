### Day 0: June 13, 2020

**Things done**: Added a list of resources to [go-resources/README.md](go-resources/README.md).

### Day 1: Jume 15, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Started with [@Todd_Mcleod](https://twitter.com/Todd_McLeod)'s [Learn How to Code: Google's Go (golang) Programming Language](https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-how-to-code) course on Udemy (super impressed so far)

**Thoughts**: Persistence is key, to keep working every day will help you succeed.
